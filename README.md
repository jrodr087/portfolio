### Tactician's Union

This is a YouTube video! Click!

[![Watch the video](https://img.youtube.com/vi/-9XNGv6Ni_w/maxresdefault.jpg)](https://youtu.be/-9XNGv6Ni_w )

A full length Tactical RPG being made in my spare time since around 2021 on Roblox.
- Worked on the entire game solo, which means I wrote all code, did all the music, art, writing, etc
- Can be played in multiplayer! Designed specifically around some multiplayer problem points I discovered in my previous project.
- Currently have about 2 to 3 hours of content in game, would like to have around 15 to 20 for a full launch.
- Still being worked on occasionally in my spare time.
- Will eventually release for free, since I'm doing this for the fun of making rather than any financial reasons.

### Bomber Town

Another YouTube video!

A Roblox game meant to replicate the multiplayer game mode of Bomberman 64.
- Another solo developed game, so responsible for all programming.
- Built on top of the inspiration taken from Bomberman 64 by adding 8+ unique bomb types.
- Positive reception when tested, but cancelled development due to personal dissatisfaction with game-feel, mostly due to online multiplayer problems.
- Took what I learned from developing this game and put it to use in the development of Tactician's Union.
