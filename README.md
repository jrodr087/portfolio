A full length Tactical RPG being made in my spare time since around 2021 on Roblox.
- Worked on the entire game solo, which means I wrote all code, did all the music, art, writing, etc
- Currently have about 2 to 3 hours of content in game, would like to have around 15 to 20 for a full launch.
- Still being worked on occasionally in my spare time.
- Will eventually release for free, since I'm doing this for the fun of making rather than any financial reasons.
